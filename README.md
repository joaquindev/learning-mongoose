learning-mongoose
=================

This is a repo for the things I'm going to learn about [Mongoose][url-mongoose] 

I'm now following this one: [rafinskipg/todoList][url-rafin]

Others sources that I've checked are the [gorgeous madhums repository][url-repo-madhums]. 

I also recommend (as Madhums repo does) to have a look at 
this other repo [node-express-mongoose boilerplate][url-boilerplate] to bootstrap your MEN projects.
